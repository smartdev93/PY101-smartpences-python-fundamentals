Programming Exercise 1.2
      Write a Python program that prints (displays):

      1. Your name
      2. Address
      3. Telephone number

      An example of the program output is shown below:

          Ken Lambert
          Virginia
          555-555-0101
      
Programming Exercise 1.4
      Figure 1-7 Python script in an IDLE window (Located in Folder)

      1. In the Code Editor, enter the program from Figure 1-7 that computes the area of a rectangle.
      2. Press the Run button, and correct any errors that occur.
      3. Test the program with different inputs.
      
      An example of the program input and output is shown below:

          Enter the width: 33
          Enter the height: 22

          The area is 726 square units.
      
      
Programming Exercise 1.5
      Modify the program from Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle.

      1. Issue the appropriate prompts for the triangle’s base and height, and change the name of the width variable to base.
      2. Use the formula 0.5 × base × height to compute the area.
      
      An example of the program input and output is shown below:
      
          Enter the base: 5
          Enter the height: 7

          The area is 17.5 square units.
      
Programming Exercise 1.7
      Write and test a program that accepts the user’s name (as text) and age (as a number) as input.

      The program should output a sentence containing the user’s name and age.

      An example of the program input and output is shown below:
      
          Enter your name: Alex
          Enter your age: 23

          Alex is 23 years old.
