Programming Exercise 8.2
      Write a GUI-based program that implements the bouncy program discussed in the program in Programing Project 4 of Chapter 3 of your book.

      Be sure to use the field names provided in the comments in your starter code.

      An example of the program is shown below:

          figure-8.2-1
            - The screen with a distance calculator for number of bounces shown. The title bar has a title, Bouncy. The window takes three inputs from the user, the initial 
            height, the bounciness index and the number of bounces in three textboxes. The initial height and bounciness index textboxes has zero point zero written by default 
            and the textbox number of bounces has a zero by default. It is followed by a button labelled Compute. Another textbox with default value zero point zero, below 
            the compute button, with title total distance is shown.
