Programming Exercise 9.3
      The __str__ method of the Bank class (in bank.py) returns a string containing the accounts in random order. Design and implement a change that causes the accounts to be
      placed in the string in ascending order of name.

      Implement the __str__ method of the bank class so that it sorts the account values before printing them to the console.

      In order to sort the account values you will need to define the __eq__ and __lt__ methods in the SavingsAccount class (in savingsaccount.py).

      The __eq__ method should return True if the account names are equal during a comparison, False otherwise.

      The __lt__ method should return True if the name of one account is less than the name of another, False otherwise.

      The program should output in the following format:

          Test for createBank:
          Name:    Jack
          PIN:     1001
          Balance: 653.0
          Name:    Mark
          PIN:     1000
          Balance: 377.0
          ...
          ...
          ...
          Name:    Name7
          PIN:     1006
          Balance: 100.0
