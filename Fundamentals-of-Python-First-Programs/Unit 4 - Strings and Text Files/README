Programming Exercise 4.1
      Write a script that inputs a line of plaintext and a distance value and outputs an encrypted text using a Caesar cipher.

      The script should work for any printable characters.

      An example of the program input and output is shown below:

          Enter a message: Hello world!
          Enter the distance value: 4

          Lipps${svph%



Programming Exercise 4.2
      Write a script that inputs a line of encrypted text and a distance value and outputs plaintext using a Caesar cipher.

      The script should work for any printable characters.

      An example of the program input and output is shown below:

          Enter the coded text: Lipps${svph%
          Enter the distance value: 4

          Hello world!

Programming Exercise 4.6
      Modify the scripts of Projects 1 and 2 to encrypt and decrypt entire files of text.

      An example of the program interface is shown below:

          Enter the input file name: encrypted.txt
          Enter the output file name: a
          Enter the distance value: 3


Programming Exercise 4.7
      Write a script that decrypts a message coded by the method used in Project 6.

      Method used in project 6:

          1. Add 1 to each characterâ€™s numeric ASCII value.
          2. Convert it to a bit string.
          3. Shift the bits of this string one place to the left.

      A single-space character in the encrypted string separates the resulting bit strings.

      An example of the program input and output is shown below:

          Enter the coded text: 0010011 1001101 1011011 1011011 1100001 000011 1110001 1100001 1100111 1011011 1001011 000101

          Hello world!


Programming Exercise 4.8
      Write a script named copyFile.py. This script should prompt the user for the names of two text files. The contents of the first file should be input and written to 
      the second file.

      An example of the program input is shown below:

          Enter the input file name: copyFrom.txt
          Enter the output file name: copyTo.txt

      Output: After running the program, a file named copyTo.txt will be outputted that contains the text from the copyFrom.txt file.
