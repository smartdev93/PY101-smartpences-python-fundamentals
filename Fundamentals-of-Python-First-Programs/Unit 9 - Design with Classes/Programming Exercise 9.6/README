Programming Exercise 9.6
      The play method in the Player class of the craps game plays an entire game without interaction with the user. Revise the Player class so that its user can make 
      individual rolls of the dice and view the results after each roll. The Player class no longer accumulates a list of rolls, but saves the string representation of 
      each roll after it is made.

      Add new methods rollDice, getNumberOfRolls, isWinner, and isLoser to the Player class. The last three methods allow the user to obtain the number of rolls and to 
      determine whether there is a winner or a loser. The last two methods are associated with new Boolean instance variables (winner and loser respectively). Two other 
      instance variables track the number of rolls and the string representation of the most recent roll (rollsCount and roll). Another instance variable (atStartup) 
      tracks whether or not the first roll has occurred.

      At instantiation, the roll, rollsCount, atStartup, winner, and loser variables are set to their appropriate initial values. All game logic is now in the rollDice 
      method. This method rolls the dice once, updates the state of the Player object, and returns a tuple of the values of the dice for that roll. Include in the module 
      the playOneGame and playManyGames functions, suitably updated for the new interface to the Player class.
