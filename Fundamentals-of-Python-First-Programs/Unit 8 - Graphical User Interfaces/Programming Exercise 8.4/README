Programming Exercise 8.4
      Modify the temperature conversion program so that it responds to the userâ€™s press of the return or enter key. If the user presses this key when the insertion point 
      is in a given field, the action which uses that field for input is triggered.

      Be sure to use the field names provided in the comments in your starter code.

      An example of the program is shown below:
          -figure-8.4-1
              The temperature converter is shown with Celsius textbox on the left, with default value zero point zero and Fahrenheit textbox in the right, with value 32 
              point zero by default. Two buttons, one with greater than signs on the left and other with less than sign on the right are placed below the textboxes. The 
              text, temperature converter GUI is written below the converter.
