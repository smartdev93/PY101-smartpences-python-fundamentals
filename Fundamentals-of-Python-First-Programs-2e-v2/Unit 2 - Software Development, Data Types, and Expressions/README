Programming Exercise 2.1
      The tax calculator program of the case study outputs a floating-point number that might show more than two digits of precision.

      Use the round function to modify the program to display at most two digits of precision in the output number.

      Below is an example of the program input and output:

          Enter the gross income: 12345.67
          Enter the number of dependents: 1

          The income tax is $-130.87
          
          
Programming Exercise 2.2
      You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.

      Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cube’s surface area as output.

      An example of the program input and output is shown below:

          Enter the cube's edge: 4

          The surface area is 96 square units.


Programming Exercise 2.3
      Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a night.

      Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total charge for a customer’s video rentals.

      The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost.

      An example of the program input and output is shown below:

          Enter the number of new videos: 3
          Enter the number of oldies: 2

          The total cost is $13.0


Programming Exercise 2.4
      Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere (a floating-point number) as input and then outputs the sphere’s:

      1. Diameter (2 × radius)
      2. Circumference (diameter × π)
      3. Surface area (4 × π × radius2)
      4. Volume (4/3 × π × radius3)
      
      For convenience, the program can import the math module.

      Below is an example of the program input and output:

          Radius = 5

          Diameter     : 10.0
          Circumference: 31.41592653589793
          Surface area : 314.1592653589793
          Volume       : 523.5987755982989


Programming Exercise 2.5
      An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity.

      Write a program that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as inputs, and then outputs its momentum.

      Below is an example of the progam input and output:

          Mass: 5
          Velocity: 2.5

          The object's momentum is 12.5


Programming Exercise 2.6
      The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula KE = ½mv2 where m is the object’s mass and v is its velocity.

      Modify the program you created in Project 5 so that it prints the object’s kinetic energy as well as its momentum.

      Below is an example of the progam input and output:

          Mass: 5
          Velocity: 2.5

          The object's momentum is 12.5
          The object's kinetic energy is 15.625


Programming Exercise 2.7
      Write a program that calculates and prints the number of minutes in a year.

      Assume the following:

        - 1 year = 365 days (Ignore leap years)
        - 1 day = 24 hours
        - 1 hour = 60 minutes
      
      Below is an example of the correct output format:

          The number of minutes in a year is X


Programming Exercise 2.8
      Light travels at 3 × 108 meters per second. A light-year is the distance a light beam travels in one year.

      Write a program that calculates and displays the value of a light-year.

      Useful facts:

          Seconds in a year = 365×24×602
          Rate = 3×108 meters per second
          
      Below is an example of the correct output format:

          Light travels X meters in a year.


Programming Exercise 2.10
      An employee’s total weekly pay equals the hourly wage multiplied by the total number of regular hours, plus any overtime pay.

      Overtime pay equals the total overtime hours multiplied by 1.5 times the hourly wage.

      Write a program that takes as inputs the hourly wage, total regular hours, and total overtime hours and displays an employee’s total weekly pay.

      Below is an example of the program inputs and output:

          Enter the wage: $15.50
          Enter the regular hours: 40
          Enter the overtime hours: 12

          The total weekly pay is $899.0
